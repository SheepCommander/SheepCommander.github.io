**Reasons datapacks are superior:**
• Doesn't take up physical space
• Doesn't cause performance issues sheerly from existing because it's not made of command blocks
• Doesn't stop working when it goes out of render distance
• Doesn't break whenever you press left click
• Allows you to use Comments
• Allows you to see all the commands at once instead of browsing through command blocks with small boxes to look at
• Allows you to use advancements, predicates, functions, loot tables, crafting recipes, custom dimensions, etc.
• Allows you to use function trees
• Allows you to run multiple commands as an entity with only one selection a.k.a. `@s`
• Allows you to have a syntax highlighter, making it easier to look at the commands by adding color
• Allows you to use cntrl + h to change values and mistakes with ease
• Allows you to detect where the world spawn is
• Allows you to insert a new command by pressing enter
• Allows you to undo mistakes
• Allows you to use external programs to help autofill commands, correct commands, and turn code into command form

**Command Block Pros:**
• Can be activated with redstone (Some people find this useful)
• Can be used to get IRL time (not 100% sure but it can be)
• Can run commands that are saved in NBT
• Doesn't require as much setup as a DP might (Depends on the kinda person you are)
• Appears to activate before DPs and detect faster

**Satire:**
• DPs don't require you to try to copy and paste a giant command from a google document that won't load
• Can parkour on CBs, but not DPs
