Go to the website, click on `1.16.4` then find what resource you want. \nEach resource has a `viewable-github-paste.md` and a `raw-discord-paste.txt`. I hope I don't have to explain what this means.\n\n**Some other plans**\nBots @Knowledge Bot and @MMK21Games that are meant to be able to grab resources from the GitHub and send them here.\n\nI also plan to setup \"triggers\"/\"auto responders\" on good ol' @Carl-bot to automatically answer easily solved questions.",
