--= **How do I add delay in a DataPack?** =--
There are 2 options,
**1**. Use the `/schedule` command. The `/schedule` command works by running the specified function after the specified time (`/schedule <namespace>:<function> <time>`) 
**2**. Use "scoreboard timers". Scoreboard Timers work by counting up by 1, then when it reaches a certain number you run some commands and reset it.

The pros and cons to each method can be found here <https://github.com/SheepCommander/KnowledgeBase/tree/main/1.16.4/pros-cons/schedule-vs-scoreboard-timers>
