With distance , you can look for entities within a certain radius of this origin. JE @a[x=37, y=74, z=212, distance=..6] looks for players within 6 blocks of [37, 74, 212]. ..x means \"x blocks away or less\", x.. means \"x blocks away or further\", and a..b means \"between a and b blocks away\" BE Use r instead: @a[x=37,y=74,z=212,r=6] Selecting players in a cuboid with dx, dy, dz JE,BE Another method is to look for entities not in a sphere but in a cuboid. Again, x, y and z specify the origin. dx, dy and dz define the size of the cuboid. Note that dx, dy and dz add 1 along every axis, so x=37, dx=10 looks for entities between x=37 and x=37+10+1=48. Also note that while distance looks for the entity's position (i.e. where the middle of its feet is), dx dy dz looks for any part of an entity's hitbox. Therefore, y=50, dy=3 also selects players at y=49, because their head is within the specified range. Selecting players in a cuboid with predicates JE Finally, you can select entities using a location_check predicate, by specifying the exact range in location_check predicate position . You can then test for it using predicate=... in an entity selector, or execute if predicate . json { \"condition\": \"minecraft:location_check\", \"predicate\": { \"position\": { \"x\": { \"min\": 38.2, \"max\": 41.7 } } } } Unlike the dx dy dz args, this does not check for an entity's hitbox but for its position. With if predicate , you can also test if the command is executed within the specified range even if there is no entity there.

don't filter anything; they specify the origin of the area you are looking in. With distance , you can look for entities within a certain radius of this origin. JE @a[x=37, y=74, z=212, distance=..6] looks for players within 6 blocks of [37, 74, 212]. ..x means \"x blocks away or less\", x.. means \"x blocks away or further\", and a..b means \"between a and b blocks away\" BE Use r instead: @a[x=37,y=74,z=212,r=6] Selecting players in a cuboid with dx, dy, dz JE,BE Another method is to look for entities not in a sphere but in a cuboid. Again, x, y and z specify the origin. dx, dy and dz define the size of the cuboid. Note that dx, dy and dz add 1 along every axis, so x=37, dx=10 looks for entities between x=37 and x=37+10+1=48. Also note that while distance looks for the entity's position (i.e. where the middle of its feet is), dx dy dz looks for any part of an entity's hitbox. Therefore, y=50, dy=3 also selects players at y=49, because their head is within the specified range. Selecting players in a cuboid with predicates JE Finally, you can select entities using a location_check predicate, by specifying the exact range in location_check predicate position . You can then test for it using predicate=... in an entity selector, or execute if predicate . json { \"condition\": \"minecraft:location_check\", \"predicate\": { \"position\": { \"x\": { \"min\": 38.2, \"max\": 41.7 } } } } Unlike the dx dy dz args, this does not check for an entity's hitbox but for its position. With if predicate , you can also test if the command is executed within the specified range even if there is no entity there.
