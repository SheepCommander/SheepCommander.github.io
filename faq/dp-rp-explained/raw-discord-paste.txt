--= **What's a DataPack? What's a Resource Pack? What's the differrence?** =--
**Datapack**
Datapacks are server side and only modify the world. They function like upgraded one command blocks, with more features and better optimization.
To install a datapack you put it into the world's files; `<world>`/`datpacks` or in 1.16 you're able to add DataPacks during the creation of the world.
Once the datapack is in the world nobody else needs to install it.

**Resourcepack**
Resourcepacks are client side and modify things like Textures, Models, Languages, Sound, and things like that.
Resourcepacks are installed per person in `%appdata%`/`.minecraft`/`resourcepacks`

**What's the difference?**
... compare them yourself
